        <h2 class="text-3xl">What are Fakemons?</h2>
        <p>Fakemons are Fan Made Pokemon. These pokemon are not associated with the actually Pokemon Francishe</p>
        <br>
        <h2 class="text-3xl">Will These Fakemons be usable in any way?</h2>
        <p>Yes, Some of the Staff members of Pokefinium, are working on making a Pokemon Showdown Server where we can use these Fakemons.</p>
        <br>
        <h2 class="text-3xl">When is the Release date of this Pokemon Showdown Server?</h2>
        <p>There is no Release Date of when the server will be launched, but we are hoping to have it done within 6 months.</p>
        <br>
        <h2 class="text-3xl">Is this only exclusive to the Pokefinium Discord Server, and it's members.</h2>
        <p>Yes, but we are a public server, so anyone can join in. All we ask is that you are in our Discord Server.</p>
        <br>
        <h2 class="text-3xl">Can I make a Fakemon?</h2>
        <p>YES! We always love seeing what people come up with. All we ask of you is to be in our Discord Server, of course.</p>
        <br>
        <h2 class="text-3xl">Can I make a Fakemon even after the server was released?</h2>
        <p>
            Yup! we will still accept Fakemons even after we are done making the Server. However, We will have a certain date when all new fakemons after the release will be added to the server.
            This is to allow those that are working really hard on making this a thing to get the time they deserve.
            The other reason is that we don't want to keep pushing these new fakemons when people are using the server, as this cause downtime in the server. So we decide
            to schedule a certain date for these new Fakemons to be added.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2 class="text-3xl">I want to make a fakemon, but I am not a good artist, what do I do?</h2>
        <p>Ask someone if they can do the art for you. If you can't do this, then you may use an artwork from the internet, but we ask that you ask permission from the artist to use their art, and credit them for the artwork.
            We are big on this, and we don't like using something that we don't have permission for, legally, and as our beliefs
